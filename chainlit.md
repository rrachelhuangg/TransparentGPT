## Hi, I'm TransparentGPT! 🚀❤️‍🔥

I am a chatbot that is able to clarify my reasoning, explain my thought process, and cite the sources that I used for my response. 

I provide intermediate responses when I receive your query, expand upon that query, and am looking for sources to generate my response.

The sources that I use for my response are exposed by prompt engineering, which means I am told to only use sources that I can provide links for. You can then click on these links to verify if the response I provided was correct or not. Along with each source, I output a percentage, that shows how helpful that source was to my response.

I also provide a percentage that shows how confident I am in each answer. Chatbots aren't perfect, but we can be pretty confident!

In the Settings UI, I provide a suite of customizable features. 

Describe each feature and what it is. 

I am built with...describe the tech, techniques, and libraries

Coffee was also a big contributor to this project. 🤎
